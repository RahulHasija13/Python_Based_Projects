# Python_Projects
Here I am going to show some projects based on python programming language.

🐍 Snake, Water, Gun Game
A simple command-line game simulating the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" variant with snake, water, and gun choices. 
The program lets the user play against the computer and keeps track of wins, losses, and draws.

🔢 Number Guessing Game
An interactive game where the computer randomly selects a number, and the user tries to guess it within limited attempts.
The program provides hints (“too high” or “too low”) to guide the player towards the correct answer.

🤖 Voice Assistant Jarvis
A basic voice-controlled assistant built with Python that can perform tasks like opening applications, searching the web, 
telling time, and responding to user commands using speech recognition and text-to-speech libraries.
